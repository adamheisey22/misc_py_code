# Energy Model Documentation

This project contains an energy model structured into multiple packages, which is documented using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/). Sphinx allows us to automatically generate documentation from the codebase and provides outputs in various formats, including HTML and Markdown.

## Introduction

The energy model consists of several packages and subpackages that are organized into functional sections. The primary goal of the documentation is to help users understand how the different components fit together and how they can be used.

The documentation is generated using Sphinx, and the output is available in both HTML and Markdown formats. The documentation automatically captures docstrings from the code, organizes modules and packages, and provides references to each class, function, and method.

## Sphinx Documentation Structure

Sphinx organizes the documentation into the following sections:

### Package Overview

The documentation starts with a general overview of the main package structure. In this project, the top-level package is `src`. Inside the `src` package, you will find the following main packages:

1. `electricity`: Contains modules related to electricity modeling and calculations.
2. `hydrogen`: Contains modules for hydrogen energy production, storage, and consumption.
3. `residential`: Contains models and utilities related to residential energy use.
4. `integrator`: Integrates components from various energy sources (electricity, hydrogen, etc.) into a cohesive system.

### Submodules and Subpackages

Each package may contain additional submodules and subpackages, which are organized in the documentation as follows:

1. **Package**: Each package (e.g., `electricity`, `hydrogen`) is documented with a high-level description of its purpose and contents.
   - **Submodules**: The individual Python modules within each package are listed and documented. For example, the `electricity` package may contain submodules like `generation.py`, `transmission.py`, and `distribution.py`. Each of these modules will have its own section.
   - **Subpackages**: If a package contains nested subpackages, these are also documented. For instance, if `residential` has a subpackage `appliances`, it will have its own subsection with corresponding submodules.

Each module's docstrings are captured to provide detailed information about functions, classes, methods, and attributes.

### Example:

For the `src` package, Sphinx might organize the contents as follows:

```
src/
│
├── electricity/
│   ├── generation.py
│   ├── transmission.py
│   └── distribution.py
│
├── hydrogen/
│   ├── production.py
│   └── storage.py
│
├── residential/
│   ├── appliances/
│   │   ├── fridge.py
│   │   └── washer.py
│   └── hvac.py
│
└── integrator/
    ├── main.py
    └── utils.py
```

In the HTML and Markdown outputs, each package and subpackage is represented with links to the respective modules, making it easy to navigate between different sections of the documentation.

## How to Build the Documentation

To generate the documentation, Sphinx must first be installed. The documentation can be built in different formats, including HTML and Markdown.

### HTML Output

To build the HTML documentation, navigate to the `docs` directory and run:

```bash
make html
```

This will generate the HTML files in the `_build/html` directory. You can open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the documentation.

### Markdown Output

To build the Markdown documentation, run the following command:

```bash
make markdown
```

The Markdown files will be generated in the `_build/markdown` directory.

## Contributing to the Documentation

If you want to contribute to the documentation, make sure to write clear and detailed docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules. The Sphinx documentation will automatically include these in the generated output.

For new features or packages, update the `index.rst` or `toc.md` file (depending on the format) to ensure the new content is included in the Table of Contents.

## Work in Progress and Feedback

Please note that this documentation is a **work in progress**. As the energy model evolves, additional details and sections will be added. We welcome any feedback, suggestions, or contributions that could help improve the clarity and usefulness of the documentation. If you encounter any gaps or areas that need further explanation, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request to enhance the documentation.
