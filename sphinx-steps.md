# Documenting Your Python Project with Sphinx

This guide walks you through using Sphinx to create documentation for a Python project. Sphinx is a powerful tool that generates documentation from your source code and Markdown files.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system.

## Installation

1. Install Sphinx using pip:

```bash
pip install sphinx
```

## Setting Up Your Documentation Directory

2. Navigate to your project directory:

```bash
cd project-dir-path
```

3. Create a directory for your documentation files:

```bash
mkdir docs
cd docs
```

4. Initialize your Sphinx documentation:

```bash
sphinx-quickstart
```

- When prompted, stick with the defaults for separating source and build directories by entering 'no'.
- Enter your project name when asked. For this guide, we'll use `sphinx-example`.
- Enter the author's names. We'll use `George W` for this example.
- For the release version, enter `v1`.

## Configuring Sphinx

5. Explore the newly created structure with the `tree` command to see what was created.

6. Edit the `conf.py` configuration file to set up your documentation environment:

```python
# Inside docs/source/conf.py

import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('..'))
```

7. Update the `extensions` list to include `sphinx.ext.autodoc`:

```python
extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']
```

8. Change the HTML theme to `sphinx_rtd_theme` for a better look:

```python
html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'
```

## Documenting Multiple Modules

9. If your project contains multiple modules, you'll need to edit the `index.rst` file to include these modules.

## Generating API Documentation

10. Run the Sphinx API doc command to generate documentation from your source code:

```bash
sphinx-apidoc -o . ..
```

- This command specifies the output path and the source path.

11. Edit the module `.rst` files to include special and private members by adding:

```rst
:special-members:
:private-members:
```

## Building Your Documentation

12. Finally, generate your HTML documentation:

```bash
make html
```

Navigate to the `_build/html` directory inside your `docs` folder and open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view your documentation.

Congratulations, you have successfully documented your Python project using Sphinx!
