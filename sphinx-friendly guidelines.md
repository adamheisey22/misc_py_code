Creating a simple Markdown guide for your code collaborators to encourage writing code that is Sphinx-friendly can significantly streamline the documentation process for Python projects. Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation, utilizing reStructuredText as its markup language. Here's a concise guide you can share with your team:

# Sphinx-friendly Python Coding Guidelines

## Introduction

This guide aims to help you write Python code and docstrings in a way that is compatible with Sphinx, facilitating automated documentation generation. By adhering to these guidelines, our codebase will maintain consistency, improve readability, and simplify documentation processes.

## Writing Docstrings

### Basic Structure

Use triple double quotes for docstrings. Begin with a summary line, followed by a more detailed explanation if necessary.

```python
def function_name(param1, param2):
    """
    Summary line.

    Extended description of function.

    :param param1: Description of param1
    :param param2: Description of param2
    :returns: Description of return value
    :rtype: The return type
    """
```

### Documenting Functions

When documenting functions, include a brief description, parameters, return values, and any exceptions raised.

```python
def add(a, b):
    """
    Add two numbers together.

    :param a: first number
    :type a: int or float
    :param b: second number
    :type b: int or float
    :return: The sum of `a` and `b`
    :rtype: int or float
    :raises TypeError: if `a` or `b` are not int or float
    """
    return a + b
```

### Documenting Classes

Document classes by explaining their purpose and documenting their methods and attributes following the same structure as functions.

```python
class Calculator:
    """
    A simple calculator class to perform basic operations.

    :Example:

    >>> calc = Calculator()
    >>> calc.add(4, 5)
    9
    """

    def add(self, a, b):
        """
        Add two numbers.

        :param a: first number
        :param b: second number
        :return: sum of `a` and `b`
        """
        return a + b
```

### Documenting Modules

At the beginning of each module, include a docstring that describes the module's purpose and any important information.

```python
"""
This module provides a Calculator class for basic arithmetic operations.
"""
```

## Code Formatting

- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs.
- **Line Length**: Aim to keep lines to 79 characters or fewer.
- **Variable Names**: Use descriptive names, and follow the `snake_case` naming convention for variables and functions.
- **Comments**: Use inline comments sparingly and ensure they are relevant and add value to understanding the code.

## Examples

Include examples in docstrings where possible, using the doctest format.

```python
def multiply(a, b):
    """
    Multiply `a` by `b`.

    :Example:

    >>> multiply(2, 3)
    6
    """
    return a * b
```

## Final Note

Following these guidelines will help ensure our code is self-documenting and makes the most of Sphinx's capabilities. For more detailed documentation on Sphinx and reStructuredText, refer to the [Sphinx documentation](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

By adopting a consistent approach to writing docstrings and adhering to Python's coding conventions, we can greatly enhance the readability, maintainability, and documentation of our codebase.
