Certainly! Let's expand on the guide by including the general structure and examples for writing Python docstrings in both NumPy and PEP 257 styles, along with integrating them with Sphinx.

### 4. Writing Docstrings: PEP 257 Style

#### General Structure
- **One-liner Docstrings**: For very simple functions.
  ```python
  def add(a, b):
      """Add two numbers and return the result."""
      return a + b
  ```
- **Multi-line Docstrings**: For more complex functions, including a summary line, a detailed description, parameters, return type, and any other important information.
  ```python
  def multiply(a, b):
      """
      Multiply two numbers and return the result.

      This function takes two numbers, multiplies them,
      and returns the result. It does not handle non-numeric types.

      Args:
          a (int): The first number.
          b (int): The second number.

      Returns:
          int: The product of a and b.
      """
      return a * b
  ```

### 5. Writing Docstrings: NumPy Style

#### General Structure
- **Sections**: Common sections include Summary, Parameters, Returns, Examples, and Notes.
  ```python
  def divide(a, b):
      """
      Divide a by b and return the result.

      Parameters
      ----------
      a : float
          Numerator.
      b : float
          Denominator; must not be zero.

      Returns
      -------
      float
          The result of division.

      Raises
      ------
      ValueError
          If b is zero.

      Examples
      --------
      >>> divide(10, 2)
      5.0

      >>> divide(5, 0)
      ValueError: Denominator must not be zero.
      """
      if b == 0:
          raise ValueError("Denominator must not be zero.")
      return a / b
  ```

### 6. Integrating Docstrings with Sphinx

- **Autodoc**: Use the autodoc extension to generate documentation from docstrings.
  - In `conf.py`, include `'sphinx.ext.autodoc'` in the `extensions` list.
  - Use directives like `.. automodule::`, `.. autofunction::`, or `.. autoclass::` in your `.rst` files to include documentation from your modules, functions, or classes.

- **Example**: To document the `multiply` function in your Sphinx documentation, you could write in an `.rst` file:
  ```
  .. autofunction:: mymodule.multiply
  ```

### 7. Generating Documentation

- **Building Docs**: Run `make html` in the command line from your documentation directory to generate HTML documentation.
- **Output**: Check the `build/html` directory for the generated documentation.

### Best Practices

- **Keep Docstrings Updated**: Always update docstrings when the code changes.
- **Clear and Concise**: Write clear, concise, and helpful descriptions.
- **Consistency**: Use a consistent style throughout the project.

By including this general structure and examples in your guide, developers will have a clearer understanding of how to write effective docstrings in both PEP 257 and NumPy styles and integrate them seamlessly with Sphinx to generate high-quality documentation.
