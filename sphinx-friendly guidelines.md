Adapting your guide to use the NumPy docstring style for Sphinx documentation can enhance clarity and consistency, especially for projects involving scientific computing or that heavily rely on NumPy. NumPy-style docstrings are well-suited for documenting APIs and are widely used in the scientific Python community. Here's how you can adjust your guide:

# Sphinx-friendly Python Coding Guidelines with NumPy Style

## Introduction

This guide is tailored for writing Python code and docstrings in a NumPy style that is compatible with Sphinx, aiming to facilitate automated documentation generation. Adopting the NumPy docstring convention will help in maintaining code readability and consistency across our documentation.

## Writing Docstrings

### General Structure

Docstrings should be enclosed in triple double quotes. The first line is a short description of the function's purpose. More detailed information follows after a blank line.

```python
def function_name(param1, param2):
    """
    Summary line.

    Extended description, if necessary.

    Parameters
    ----------
    param1 : type
        Description of param1.
    param2 : type
        Description of param2.

    Returns
    -------
    type
        Description of the return value.
    """
```

### Documenting Functions

Document functions by including sections for the summary, parameters, returns, and other relevant information.

```python
def add(a, b):
    """
    Add two numbers together.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : int or float
        First number.
    b : int or float
        Second number.

    Returns
    -------
    int or float
        Sum of `a` and `b`.
    """
    return a + b
```

### Documenting Classes

When documenting classes, describe the purpose of the class and include documentation for methods and attributes using the same structure as for functions.

```python
class Calculator:
    """
    A simple calculator class for basic operations.

    Methods
    -------
    add(a, b)
        Add two numbers together.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> calc = Calculator()
    >>> calc.add(4, 5)
    9
    """

    def add(self, a, b):
        """
        Add two numbers together.

        Parameters
        ----------
        a : int or float
            First number.
        b : int or float
            Second number.

        Returns
        -------
        int or float
            Sum of `a` and `b`.
        """
        return a + b
```

### Documenting Modules

Include a module-level docstring at the beginning of each file, detailing the module's purpose and any notable information.

```python
"""
This module provides a Calculator class for performing basic arithmetic operations.
"""
```

## Code Formatting

- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
- **Line Length**: Prefer lines to be 79 characters or less.
- **Variable Names**: Use descriptive names and adhere to the `snake_case` naming convention.
- **Comments**: Use comments to explain the "why" behind code, not the "what".

## Examples

Provide examples using the doctest format to demonstrate function usage.

```python
def multiply(a, b):
    """
    Multiply `a` by `b`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : int or float
        First number.
    b : int or float
        Second number.

    Returns
    -------
    int or float
        Product of `a` and `b`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> multiply(2, 3)
    6
    """
    return a * b
```

## Conclusion

Adhering to the NumPy docstring style can significantly improve the quality and consistency of our project documentation, especially when used in conjunction with Sphinx. This style is particularly useful for projects with a focus on numerical computing. For comprehensive details on the NumPy docstring standard and Sphinx, refer to the respective documentation resources.

By following these guidelines, we enhance the documentation of our codebase, making it more accessible and easier to maintain.
