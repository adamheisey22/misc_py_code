# Contribution Guide

We welcome contributions to our project and appreciate your effort to improve it! To ensure a smooth and organized workflow, please follow these steps when contributing to the main repository on our internal GitLab account:

## Steps to Contribute

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the main repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.example.com/your-project/main-repo.git
   cd main-repo
   ```

2. **Create a New Branch**: In the cloned repository, create a new branch for your contribution. Use a descriptive name for your branch that reflects the nature of your changes. For example:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-awesome-feature
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes in the new branch. Make sure to follow our coding standards and include appropriate tests and documentation.

4. **Commit Your Changes**: Once your changes are ready, commit them with a meaningful commit message. Please make sure your commit messages are clear and concise.

5. **Push Your Branch**: Push your branch to the main repository on GitLab:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/new-awesome-feature
   ```

6. **Open a Merge Request**: Open a merge request (MR) from your branch to the `main` branch of the main repository. Provide a detailed description of your changes and any relevant information that will help in reviewing your MR.

7. **Request a BlueSky Member for Merge**: Once your MR is ready for review, request a BlueSky member to review and merge your changes into the `main` branch. You can do this by tagging a BlueSky member in your merge request comments or by reaching out to them directly.

## Guidelines

- **Code Quality**: Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards and is well-documented.
- **Testing**: Include tests for your changes to ensure they work as expected and do not introduce regressions.
- **Documentation**: Update or add documentation as needed to explain your changes and how to use any new features.
- **Discussions**: Feel free to start a discussion if you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the project.

We appreciate your contributions and efforts to improve our project. Thank you for your collaboration!
