## Connecting to a Database and Querying with Pandas in Jupyter Notebook

This guide demonstrates how to connect to a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy and how to perform queries and return the results as Pandas DataFrames in a Jupyter Notebook.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have SQLAlchemy and Pandas installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install sqlalchemy pandas
```

### Step 1: Connect to the Database

First, establish a connection to your SQLite database using SQLAlchemy.

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

# Connect to the database (replace 'your_database.db' with your database file)
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///your_database.db')
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()
```

### Step 2: Define Your Table Classes

Define classes that correspond to the tables in your database. Here's an example for a table named `EIA930Balance`:

```python
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String

Base = declarative_base()

class EIA930Balance(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'eia930_balance'
    balance_id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    some_column = Column(String)
```

### Step 3: Querying with Pandas

Use Pandas to execute queries and return the results as DataFrames.

#### Basic Query Example

Retrieve all rows from the `EIA930Balance` table:

```python
import pandas as pd

query = session.query(EIA930Balance).statement
df = pd.read_sql(query, session.bind)
df.head()  # Displays the first few rows
```

#### Advanced Query Example

Perform a more complex query with filters:

```python
query = session.query(EIA930Balance.balance_id, EIA930Balance.some_column).filter(EIA930Balance.some_column == 'value').statement
df = pd.read_sql(query, session.bind)
df.head()
```

Replace `some_column` and `'value'` with the actual column name and the value you want to filter by.

### Closing the Session

After completing your database operations, close the session:

```python
session.close()
```

### Conclusion

This guide shows how to connect to a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy, define table classes, and perform queries with Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook, returning the results as DataFrames.
