## Introduction
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. SQLAlchemy is a comprehensive and flexible ORM library for Python. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and using SQLAlchemy to interact with an SQLite database.

## Installation
First, you need to install SQLAlchemy. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install sqlalchemy
```

For SQLite support, the necessary libraries are included with Python, so no additional installation is needed.

## Setting Up the Database
Before interacting with the database, you need to set up a connection. This is done by creating an engine.

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///example.db')
```

## Defining Models
Models in SQLAlchemy are Python classes that define the structure of the database tables. Each model is a subclass of `Base`, which is defined using the `declarative_base` function.

```python
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String

Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    age = Column(Integer)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<User(name='{self.name}', age='{self.age}')>"
```

## Creating the Database
Once you have defined your models, you can create the database and tables.

```python
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

## CRUD Operations
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the basic operations you can perform on a database.

### Create
To add new records to the database, you create instances of your models and add them to the session.

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

new_user = User(name='John Doe', age=30)
session.add(new_user)
session.commit()
```

### Read
To read data from the database, you query the session.

```python
users = session.query(User).all()
for user in users:
    print(user)
```

### Update
To update existing records, you query for the records, modify them, and commit the changes.

```python
user = session.query(User).filter_by(name='John Doe').first()
user.age = 31
session.commit()
```

### Delete
To delete records, you query for the records, delete them, and commit the changes.

```python
user = session.query(User).filter_by(name='John Doe').first()
session.delete(user)
session.commit()
```

## Advanced Queries
SQLAlchemy supports a variety of advanced queries. Here are some examples:

### Filtering
```python
young_users = session.query(User).filter(User.age < 30).all()
```

### Ordering
```python
ordered_users = session.query(User).order_by(User.age).all()
```

### Joins
```python
# Assuming we have another model called Address
class Address(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'addresses'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.id'))
    email = Column(String)
    user = relationship("User", back_populates="addresses")

User.addresses = relationship("Address", order_by=Address.id, back_populates="user")

users_with_addresses = session.query(User).join(Address).all()
```

## Relationships
In SQLAlchemy, you can define relationships between tables. Here's an example of a one-to-many relationship:

```python
from sqlalchemy import ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

class Address(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'addresses'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.id'))
    email = Column(String)
    user = relationship("User", back_populates="addresses")

User.addresses = relationship("Address", order_by=Address.id, back_populates="user")
```

## Session Management
Sessions in SQLAlchemy are used to manage the transactions. It's important to handle sessions properly to ensure data integrity and performance.

### Creating a Session
```python
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()
```

### Committing a Session
```python
session.commit()
```

### Rolling Back a Session
If something goes wrong, you can roll back the session to undo changes.

```python
session.rollback()
```

### Closing a Session
```python
session.close()
```

## Conclusion
This guide provides an overview of using SQLAlchemy ORM to interact with an SQLite database. SQLAlchemy offers a powerful and flexible way to manage your database interactions in a Pythonic way. For more advanced usage, refer to the [SQLAlchemy documentation](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/).
