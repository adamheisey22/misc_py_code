# Installing and Using AutoDocstring in VS Code

## Introduction

AutoDocstring is a Visual Studio Code extension that automatically generates docstrings for Python functions, methods, and classes. It supports various docstring formats, including Google, NumPy, and Sphinx. This guide will walk you through the steps to install AutoDocstring in VS Code and demonstrate its usage with a focus on documenting code that uses `numpy`.

## Installation

1. **Open Visual Studio Code.**
2. **Access the Extensions View** by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
3. **Search for AutoDocstring.** Type "AutoDocstring" into the search box.
4. **Install the extension.** Find the extension in the list and click the "Install" button.

## Configuration

After installation, you might want to configure AutoDocstring to suit your needs, especially if you prefer a specific docstring format like NumPy.

1. **Open Settings.** Press `Ctrl+,` or go to `File > Preferences > Settings`.
2. **Search for AutoDocstring.** Use the search bar at the top.
3. **Find the "AutoDocstring: Docstring Format" setting.** You can choose from `default`, `google`, `sphinx`, or `numpy`. Select `numpy` if you're focusing on `numpy` code.
4. **Adjust other settings as needed,** such as whether to generate docstrings on typing `"""` and more.

## Usage

To use AutoDocstring, follow these steps:

1. **Write a Python function or method.** For example, a function that uses `numpy`:

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    def calculate_statistics(data):
        """[summary]

        Args:
            data ([type]): [description]

        Returns:
            [type]: [description]
        """
        mean = np.mean(data)
        median = np.median(data)
        std_dev = np.std(data)
        return mean, median, std_dev
    ```

2. **Generate the docstring.** Place the cursor on the line immediately below the function definition and type `"""` then press `Enter`, or use the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+2`. AutoDocstring will automatically generate a template based on your configuration.

    Using the NumPy format, the extension will produce something like this:

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    def calculate_statistics(data):
        """
        Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation of the given data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : array_like
            The input data.

        Returns
        -------
        mean : float
            Mean of the data.
        median : float
            Median of the data.
        std_dev : float
            Standard deviation of the data.
        """
        mean = np.mean(data)
        median = np.median(data)
        std_dev = np.std(data)
        return mean, median, std_dev
    ```

3. **Fill in the placeholders.** Replace `[summary]`, `[type]`, and `[description]` with actual descriptions of your function, parameters, and return values.

## Tips for Documenting NumPy Code

- **Describe array shapes and dtypes:** When documenting functions that use `numpy`, be clear about the expected shapes and data types of array inputs and outputs.
- **Include examples:** Adding examples to your docstrings can significantly improve their usefulness, especially for complex numerical computations.
- **Use precise language:** Be specific about what your function does, its parameters, and its returns to avoid ambiguity.

## Conclusion

AutoDocstring is a powerful tool for generating docstrings in Python, particularly useful for projects that use `numpy` and other scientific computing libraries. By following this guide, you can streamline your documentation process in VS Code, ensuring your code is more readable and maintainable.
