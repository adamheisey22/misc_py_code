## Guide to Setting Up Anaconda Environment, Installing `rsconnect-jupyter`, and Publishing Jupyter Notebooks to Posit Connect

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up an Anaconda environment, install `rsconnect-jupyter` to run Jupyter notebooks on Posit Connect, connect to the Posit server, create and use an API key for connection, and publish and push notebooks to the server.

### Step 1: Create an Anaconda Environment

First, you need to have Anaconda installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, download and install Anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

#### 1.1 Create a New Environment

Open your terminal (or Anaconda Prompt on Windows) and create a new environment:

```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.9
```

Activate the newly created environment:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

### Step 2: Install `rsconnect-jupyter`

With your new environment activated, install the necessary packages:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge jupyter
pip install rsconnect-jupyter
```

### Step 3: Connect to Posit Server

To connect to the Posit server, you need to generate an API key.

#### 3.1 Generate API Key

1. Log in to your Posit Connect server.
2. Navigate to your user profile settings.
3. Find the "API Keys" section and generate a new API key.

#### 3.2 Configure `rsconnect-jupyter`

In your terminal, configure `rsconnect-jupyter` with the API key:

```bash
rsconnect add --server https://<your-posit-connect-server-url> --api-key <your-api-key>
```

### Step 4: Publish and Push Notebooks to Server

Now you can publish your Jupyter notebooks to the Posit Connect server.

#### 4.1 Create and Publish a Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Create a new notebook or open an existing one.

3. To publish the notebook, run the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    rsconnect deploy notebook <path-to-your-notebook>.ipynb
    ```
