# Energy Demand Imputation Function Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the functionality of the `fill_demand_ba` function, which is designed to impute missing or invalid energy demand data for different Balancing Authorities (BAs). The function addresses two main scenarios: missing data and data that falls outside a reasonable range.

## Functionality

### Imputation Logic
The function follows a multi-step process to impute data:

1. **Threshold Calculation/Assignment**: 
   - For each BA, if a predefined threshold exists in the `df_threshold` table, it is used.
   - If no predefined threshold exists, the threshold is calculated based on 3 standard deviations from the mean demand of that BA.

2. **Data Validation**:
   - The function validates each demand value against its BA's threshold (lower threshold is set to 0, upper threshold as per step 1).

3. **Imputation Process**:
   - The function attempts to impute missing or invalid demand values following these steps:
     - **Demand Forecast**: If a valid demand forecast is available and the BA is not in the exception list, use the forecast value.
     - **Previous Hour Demand**: If the forecast is not available/usable, the function tries to use the demand value from the previous hour.
     - **Same Hour Previous Day**: If the previous hour's demand is also not available, the function uses the demand value from the same hour on the prior day.
     - **Zero Filling**: If none of the above steps yield a valid demand value, the function imputes the demand as 0.

### Exception Handling
- The function includes logic to handle exceptions where certain BAs should not use demand forecast values for imputation. These exceptions are defined in a separate lookup table (`ba_no_forec_lkup_table.csv`).

### Group-wise Operation
- The imputation logic is applied group-wise, separately for each BA, to ensure data consistency and integrity within each group.

## Usage

### Inputs
- `df`: The main DataFrame containing energy demand data along with BA, timestamp, and demand forecast.
- `df_threshold`: (Optional) A DataFrame containing predefined lower and upper thresholds for each BA.

### Output
- The function returns the input DataFrame with an additional column `imputed_demand`, which contains the imputed demand values.

## Example

To use the function:

```python
df_imp = fill_demand_ba(df_out, df_threshold)
```

Here, `df_out` is your main DataFrame, and `df_threshold` is the DataFrame containing any predefined thresholds.

## Conclusion

The `fill_demand_ba` function provides a comprehensive solution for imputing missing or invalid energy demand data, ensuring reliable and consistent data for analysis and decision-making processes in the energy sector.
